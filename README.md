# Object-Detection
In this project we detected the potholes on roads using computer vision and deep learning techniques. In this project I leveraged YoloV3 algorithm and pjreddie darknet repository. The project originally was a group project I will share that github link as well once that is published by the other group member. However, this is my personal work which I was maintaining and creating simultaneously on a smaller dataset.
