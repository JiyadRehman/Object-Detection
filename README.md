# Object-Detection
In this project we detected the potholes on roads using computer vision and deep learning techniques. In this project I leveraged YoloV3 algorithm and pjreddie darknet repository. The project originally was a group project I will share that github link as well once that is published by the other group member. However, this is my personal work which I was maintaining and creating simultaneously on a smaller dataset. The project was developed on Google Colab using Python programming language.


Steps to be followed:
1. Download images that you will annoate
2. From github download VoTT tool. Can be found on this link (https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT)
3. Annotate the object within the images. For us objects were potholes
4. Put these annotated images on Google drive in a folder
5. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook
6. Mount Google drive on Google Colab.
7. After doing the above steps you can have look over the code and along with the comments it explain rest of the steps that includes cloning repos and others.
8. You need to make few changes in config files as per your requirements that are shared as well.


Some of the codes have been taken from other free resources
